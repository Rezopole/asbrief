Description: C++ utility that fastly aggregates network statistics.
 for a set of pcap cpature-files, asbrief produces summarizations :
  • per AS repartitions
  • from-AS / dest-AS matrices
  • arbitrary-length-prefix repartitions and matrices
  • all the above per IPv4 and per IPv6
  • per mac-address repartitions and matrices
  • per ethertype repartitions
  • vlan repartitions
  in  order  to get IP/AS bindings, asbriefs either dns-query reference
  servers such as Rezopole's servers, or use a locally  supplied  full-
  view file.
