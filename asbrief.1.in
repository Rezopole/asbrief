.SH NAME
asbrief \- a C++ utility that fastly aggregates network statistics.
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B asbrief
.RI "[-h|--help] [... [--capture=]" filename " ...] [--count=" nbpackets "]"
.in 15
.RI "[--ceil=" xx "%] [--sizes] [--frames] [--sizes+frames (default)]"
.RI "[--mask=(" 0-32 ")] [--nomask] [--ipv4mask=(" "0-32)" "] [--ipv6mask=(" 0-128 ")]"
.RI "[--fullview=" fname "] [--reportnodata]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
for a set of
.B pcap
cpature-files,
.B asbrief
produces summarizations :
.IP \[bu] 2
per AS repartitions
.IP \[bu] 2
from-AS / dest-AS matrices
.IP \[bu] 2
arbitrary-length-prefix repartitions and matrices
.IP \[bu] 2
all the above per IPv4 and per IPv6
.IP \[bu] 2
per mac-address repartitions and matrices
.IP \[bu] 2
per ethertype repartitions
.IP \[bu] 2
vlan repartitions

in order to get IP/AS bindings,
.B asbriefs
either dns-query
.I reference servers
such as
.BR Rezopole "'s"
servers, or use a locally supplied
.IR "full-view file" "."


.SH OPTIONS

.SS
.BR -h " | " -help
display a short help reminder.
.SS
.BI --capture= "filename"
.B pcap-format
capture-file to be analysed.
.SS
.BI --count= "nbpackets"
limit the scope of analyse to the
.I nbpackets
first packets in the capture file.
.SS
.BI --ceil= "tot-percent" %
limit the display up to a total of
.I tot-percent
of the global amount of packets or byte-size.
useful for preventing the display of the long tail of highly dispersed small data.
default :
.BR 95 "%."
.SS
.B --sizes
display only
.BR byte-size "-ponderated"
repartitions.
.SS
.B --frames
display only
.BR frame-count "-ponderated"
repartitions.
.SS
.B --sizes+frames
display both
.BR frame-count "-ponderated"
and
.BR frame-count "-ponderated"
repartitions. it is the default behaviour and it can be a bit verbose ...
.SS
.BR "--mask=" mask-size
summarize repartitions by prior-simplifying addresses using the supplied
.IR mask-size "."

The given size is user for
.BR IPv4 ","
in the [0..32] range. A corresponding
.B IPv6
converted mask is computed by x2 multiplication.

Example :
.I --mask=24
will use
.B /24
simplification for IPv4 and
.B /48
for IPv6.

default :
.B 24
.SS
.B --nomask
Do not prior-simplify addresses with a mask before aggregations.

Mandatory for per-host precise repartitions.
.SS
.BI "--ipv4mask=" IPv4-mask-size
summarize repartitions by prior-simplifying
.B IPv4
addresses using the supplied
.IR mask-size "."
.SS
.BI "--ipv6mask=" IPv6-mask-size
summarize repartitions by prior-simplifying
.B IPv6
addresses using the supplied
.IR mask-size "."
.SS
.BI --fullview= "filename"
Use the supplied file as a Cisco-output "full BGP view" in order to bind IP-addresses to Autonomous-Systems (AS).
The parsing of the intput can be rather long.
.SS
.B --reportnodata
Report when some IP to AS lookup reached no data when dns-querying to
.I reference-servers
for those binding.
.SH OUTPUT
Some (few) output come from libpcap and (halas) can not be prevented.

Each summarization is labeled and each line contains the percentage of
the total amount and the sum of previous percentages up to the current.
.SH RETURNED VALUES
.B asbrief
returns
.B 1
(error) whenever major errors prevented the summarization, otherwise
.B 0
(success) is returned.
