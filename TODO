            check for multiple-AS appartainances (?)
            retrieve the full view via snmp ??
            use whois and an inner cache for per-AS repartition
    [done]  use a BGP full-view dump for per-AS repartition
    [~done] use a mac-address registry for human-clarifyed output (iptraf format ?)
	    use timestamps in order to output average rates ???

command flags
    [done]  toggle between packet number views or packet size views

            provide a neutral and rather exhaustive capture for unit-testings
