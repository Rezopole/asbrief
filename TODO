BUG !
    [done]   verify prefix inclusion matching into getAS procedure !!!
    [done]   be classful-IPv4 aware and behave accordingly for full-view parsing
             introduce a default local AS for locally announced prefix (empty AS-paths)

             introduce RF1918 privates spaces ...


ICMP ???

ICMPV6 : dst endress ending with ':' to remove !

ergonomy
	    provide an inner piped-call for tcpdump rather than guessing the proper pipe ?
	    man pages, examples

data sorting and consolidations
            read _All_ prefixes as-path and not only the _Bests_.
            check for multiple-AS appartainances (?)
            retrieve the full view via snmp ??
            use whois and an inner cache for per-AS repartition
    [done]  use a BGP full-view dump for per-AS repartition
    [~done] use a mac-address registry for human-clarifyed output (iptraf format ?)
	    use timestamps in order to output average rates ???

command flags
    [done]  toggle between packet number views or packet size views

Unit Testings
            provide a neutral and rather exhaustive capture for unit-testings

Output
	    json-encoded output
	    html output
	    svg or better ?
