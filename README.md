# capstat #

## network-traffic AS-repartitions ##

**capstat** is a C++ utility that fastly aggregates network statistics.

from a set of libpcap captures it will produce :

- [x] per AS repartitions
- [x] from-AS / dest-AS matrices
- [x] arbitrary-length-prefix repartitions and matrices
- [x] all the above IPv4 and IPv6

and also the more common :
* per mac-address repartitions and matrices
* per ethertype repartitions
* vlan repartitions
* ...

## requirements ##
**libpcap** needs to be linked against the regular **libpcap** libraries, thus, for example, *debian-alike* machines would need **libpcap-dev** packages.

**libpcap** needs to be linked against the regular **libresolv** libraries, thus, for example, *debian-alike* machines have it provided via **libc6-dev**

the regular **STL** library is used too, so a valid **C++** compiler and templates is mandatory at building.

Now that an **external dns service** is used for matching IP with AS (rezopole's goasmap/asdig) the requirement of a **bgp full-view** isn't as mandatory as it used to, though it's still possible to use a particular local fullview, say for local-tuned results.

##build##
yet there is no *autoconf* involved, so the **Makefile** may need some tuning with uncommon machines.

```
shell> make
g++ -Wall -o capstat capstat.cpp -lpcap
echo extracting full-view sample from archive
extracting full-view sample from archive
gzip -dc full.bgp.txt.gz > full.bgp.txt
```

##use##
Here's below an example of use on a single-host end-user capture (september 2016).
You'll notice that **one third** of the capture was **IPv6**, because the Internet-provider involved do supply **public IPv6 to the end-user**.

Default full-view and an AS-names list are provided, but for accuracy you **must** match the captures with full-views close in time, and probably
supplied by your own routers.

```
# first get a capture to analyse !
shell> tcpdump -i en0 -c 10000 -w capture_file.pcap
    .../...

# process the capture
shell> capstat capture_file.pcap --sizes
ipv4mask = 255.255.255.0
ipv6mask = ffff:ffff:ffff::

##TODO##

#### BUGs !
- [x] verify prefix inclusion matching into getAS procedure !!!
- [x] be classful-IPv4 aware and behave accordingly for full-view parsing
- [ ] introduce a default local AS for locally announced prefix ie empty AS-paths)
- [x] introduce RF1918 privates spaces ... (considered done via external lookup)
- [ ] ICMP ???
- [ ] ICMPV6 : dst endress ending with ':' to remove !

#### ergonomy
- [x]	provide an inner piped-call for tcpdump rather than guessing the proper pipe ? (moved to libpcap instead)
- [ ]	man pages, examples

#### data sorting and consolidations
- [x]   use a dns-provided external lookup for IP-AS matches
- [ ]   read _All_ prefixes as-path from instead of only the _Bests_.
- [ ]   check for multiple-AS appartainances (?)
- [x]   retrieve the full view via snmp ?? (probably won't do, because of new external lookup)
- [ ]   use whois and an inner cache for per-AS repartition
- [x]   use a BGP full-view dump for per-AS repartition
- [x]   use a mac-address registry for human-clarifyed output (iptraf format ?)
- [ ]	use timestamps in order to output average rates ???

#### command flags
- [x]	toggle between packet number views or packet size views

#### Unit Testings
- [ ]   provide a neutral and rather exhaustive capture for unit-testings

#### Outputs
- [ ]	json-encoded output
- [ ]	html output
- [ ]	svg or better output ?


##unit-tests##
there are not many unit-tests yet, but the target do exist in the makefile :

```
shell>make test
./capstat --fullview=full.bgp.txt --dumpfv
reading full view ...  done. 597814 IPv4 prefixes (53629 AS), 29939 IPv6 prefixes (11463 AS).   total :  53929 AS
ipv4mask = 255.255.255.0
.../...
diff fullfv_dump.bis.txt fullfv_dump.txt  && echo "      fullview re-reading test ok" && rm fullfv_dump.bis.txt
      fullview re-reading test ok
```
